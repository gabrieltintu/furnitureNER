# Furniture NER

Python project designed to scrape URLs containing furniture product information and apply a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that detects and extracts furniture-related entities from the scraped text.


## Features

- Scrape URLs: Get URLs from a CSV file, scrape the text content from each URL using BeautifulSoup and generates .txt files;
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Train NER model using a given data set to recognize and extract furniture product names;
- Output Generation: Generates output files after applying the NER model containing the extracted furniture entities;.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/gabrieltintu/furnitureNER.git

Install the required dependencies:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
The model is already trained and applied to a data set. If you want to train it and use it again follow the next steps:

- delete the models and the output directory generated by NER testing;
- in ner_test.py load the model you want to use (trained or trained_improved);

For the first train:
    
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh

For the improved training:

- uncomment the lines 8-9 and comment 4-5, 12-13; then run the script again
