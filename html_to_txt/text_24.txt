We believe that furniture you like and wish to use for a long time should not have to be replaced in a hurry. With that in mind, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that all our products are designed and constructed to last! By following these simple care instructions, you too can do your bit to enjoy your furniture for years to come. For any other queries or information, feel free to contact us.
General Care
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning; you can also use a mild environmentally friendly detergent
Always dry your furniture afterwards using a clean cotton cloth
Do not use abrasive detergents or abrasive sponges and cloths
Always protect your furniture from hot objects, liquids and dirt
Clean up spills immediately with a dry cloth
Avoid dragging sharp or rough objects across the surface of your furniture to prevent scratches
From time to time it may be necessary to tighten fittings; this is normal with all furniture and regular inspections should be carried out
Laminate
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning
In case of textured laminates you can use a soft scrub brush to prevent build-up of dust
Remove ink, wine, wax crayons and similar stains using acetone or methylated spirits; wipe the surface with water and a mild environmentally friendly detergent; finish off by wiping the surface dry
Veneer
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning
It is important to wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry afterwards with a clean cotton cloth
To remove dirt and finger prints, use a mild environmentally friendly detergent; dilute the detergent, dampen a soft cloth with it and wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry with a clean cotton cloth
Avoid cleaning products that contain oils or are ammonia based
Moisture and heat can damage any wood finish so protect your furniture from direct sunlight or excessive temperatures; always leave an air gap between your furniture and a radiator or similar heat source
Always use placemats, coasters and trivets to protect the surface from dents, scratches, heat and moisture from hot or cold liquids
Avoid direct contact with candle wax as it may react with the veneer's finish and leave a stain
Solid Wood
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning
It is important to wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry afterwards with a clean, dry cloth
To remove dirt and finger prints, use a mild environmentally friendly detergent; dilute the detergent, dampen a soft cloth with it and wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry with a clean cotton cloth
Moisture and heat can damage or discolor any wood finish so protect your furniture from direct sunlight or excessive temperatures; always leave an air gap between your wood furniture and a radiator or similar heat source
Always use placemats, coasters and trivets to protect the surface from dents, scratches, heat and moisture from hot or cold liquids
If you choose to use protective covers, do not use vinyl or plastic material; they do not allow ventilation so  trap moisture and can give rise to mold and mildew
For long-lasting protection, it is advisable to wax your wood furniture once a year
Wood will expand and contract with seasonal humidity changes; maintain consistent humidity levels to minimize movement in the wood and prevent warping
Over time, air and sunlight will change the color of natural wood slightly; occasionally rotate the items placed on your wood furniture to allow a more uniform color to develop
