As a testament to the hand-carved aspect of the design, every Bwindi is unique. NATURAL MATERIALSEvery Uniqwa piece has a story…Our collections are mostly individually hand-made pieces. As most of our products are made from natural materials, texture, colour, and pattern may vary from piece to piece. Reclaimed timbers, naturally weathered materials and off-cuts otherwise discarded are frequently part of Uniqwa design features.Natural splitting, cracking, and loss of natural oils may occur and form part of the characteristics and beauty of Uniqwa products. These are not viewed as imperfections or faults but as part of timber's natural life and beauty.We believe the result of using natural materials and hand-crafted elements is a testament to the unique qualities found in materials originating from nature.As every monitor displays different colour tones, the colour of pictures on our website and social media cannot be taken as a true colour indication of the actual products. Some product tones may appear to vary from catalogue or website images.
