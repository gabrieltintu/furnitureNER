Inspiration
Solid. A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. “When she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson – Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.”
The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view.
Fabrication
Made using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request.
The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt’s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.
