SHOP THIS SOFACUSTOMER REVIEWMota Sofa"I LOVE it. It’s beautiful, comfortable, nontoxic and earth friendly. The fabric is beautiful and soft and feels luxurious. It sits really well. I wanted something with high sides so you can lounge from any direction. It’s firm enough that you can also sit up properly."
