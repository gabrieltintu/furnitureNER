Description
Drama in all the right places
Whilst we love the beauty of natural oak, sometimes a little drama is needed. So if your space is full of white oak why not contrast with the Stark? Contrasting oak strip panels define this collection along with soft-closing doors to reveal a sleek black cavity space that's just as beautiful as the outside.
Black and Natural contrasting Oak defines the Stark. A striking contemporary collection with sliding doors to reveal a sleek black cavity space that's just as beautiful as the outside.
Dimensions:
W159 D45 H76.1CM
The Timber
Wood displays different grain patterns depending on which way they are cut - for example, the 'medullary ray' which can appear on oak furniture is a mark of good quality timber, these are just characteristics of the natural beauty of the wood. Wood veneers also allow distinctive patterns to be created on some surfaces, such as table tops and drawer fronts by the way slivers are arranged. All timber and veneer surfaces will change colour and mellow over time. New furniture will initially vary in shade from items that have been previously purchased.
